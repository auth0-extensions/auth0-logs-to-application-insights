# Auth0 - Logs to Application Insights Webtask

[![Auth0 Extensions](http://cdn.auth0.com/extensions/assets/badge.svg)](https://sandbox.it.auth0.com/api/run/auth0-extensions/extensions-badge?webtask_no_cache=1)

This extension will take all of your Auth0 logs and export them to Application Insights

## Configure Application Insights

First you'll need an Application Insights account which you can create for free in your [Azure Subscription](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AppInsights).

## Configure Webtask

If you haven't configured Webtask on your machine run this first:

```
npm i -g wt-cli
wt init
```

> Requires at least node 0.10.40 - if you're running multiple version of node make sure to load the right version, e.g. "nvm use 0.10.40"

## Deploy to Webtask.io

To run it on a schedule (run every 5 minutes for example):

```
wt cron schedule \
    --name auth0-logs-to-application-insights \
    --secret AUTH0_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN" \
    --secret AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_ID" \
    --secret AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SECRET" \
    --secret APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY="YOUR_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY" \
    --json \
    "*/5 * * * *" \
    ./build/bundle.js
```

> You can get your Global Client Id/Secret here: https://auth0.com/docs/api/v1

* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
